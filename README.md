## Purpose

This project is in fulfilment of Writing Workshop as Explore AI Academy students.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a supply chain logistics analysis project. The project aims to optimize supply chain operations, enhance decision-making, and provide valuable insights for improving efficiency. It includes an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing information related to order processing, freight rates, warehouse costs, plant capacities, product distribution, customer relationships, and plant-port associations.

## Project Components

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Data Files:** The primary dataset is stored in the Excel file 'Supply chain logistics problem.xlsx.' It contains seven tables, each capturing specific aspects of the supply chain.

2. **Code:** The code for data loading, EDA, visualization, and analysis is organized into Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`).

3. **Reports:** The project includes two main deliverables:
   - A comprehensive project report (`Project_Report.pdf`) summarizing the findings from the EDA, visualization, and analysis.
   - A team presentation (`Presentation.pdf`) to share insights with stakeholders.

4. **README:** This README file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, structure, and usage instructions.

## Data Description

### Tables in the Dataset

1. 'OrderList': Information related to orders, order processing, and customer details.
2. 'FreightRates': Details about freight rates, carriers, and transportation services.
3. 'WhCosts': Warehouse operating costs and cost per unit.
4. 'WhCapacities': Warehouse capacity data.
5. 'ProductsPerPlant': Product distribution across plants.
6. 'VmiCustomers': Customer relationships and orders.
7. 'PlantPorts': Plant and port associations for logistics.

## Usage

1. **Data Loading:** Use the provided code to load the dataset and store it as DataFrames for analysis. The dataset is stored in 'Supply chain logistics problem.xlsx.'

2. **EDA and Visualization:** Explore each table in the dataset to identify relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Calculate and visualize these KPIs to gain insights.

3. **Analysis and Recommendations:** Analyze the visualizations and findings to make recommendations for supply chain optimization and improvements.

4. **Reports and Presentation:** Review the project report ('Project_Report.pdf') for a detailed summary of findings. Prepare and deliver the team presentation ('Presentation.pdf') to share insights.
